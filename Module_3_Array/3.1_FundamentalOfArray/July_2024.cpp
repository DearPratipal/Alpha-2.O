/*
An array is a type of data structure used to store a group or collection of items or elements
sequentially in memory.
• The main function of an array is to store a collection of homogenous data of the same type
(e.g., integers, strings, floating numbers).
• Arrays use 0-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second element is at
index 1, and so on.
• Elements can be directly accessed using their indexes.
• Memory allocation in arrays is contiguous in nature, allowing for efficient data management
and access.
